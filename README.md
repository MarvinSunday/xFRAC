## Overview
xFRAC is XRP Ledger’s First Native Fractional NFT Marketplace. This platform helps to increase the liquidity and tradability of XRPL NFTs using a simple Issuer Wallet, AMM, Native XRPL DEX, XLS-20 NFTs, and XRPL Token concepts. The xFRAC platform allows users to change their NFTs into Fractional NFTs to boost the tradability of the NFT Asset on the XRPL through the Native DEX and AMM. xFRAC's concept of fractional NFTs involves converting them into a fungible derivative of the actual NFTs through the rTokenization process. This process allows for the easy forward and backward conversion of NFTs on the xFRAC platform, and this gives birth to an asset category still on the XRPL Token infrastructure earlier stated as rTokens. The final aim of building the infrastructure is to make NFTs highly liquidity and possibly distribute the ownership of NFTs across many XRPL wallets due to the fungible state of rTokens.
